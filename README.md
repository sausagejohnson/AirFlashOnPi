The AirFlash is an open-source standalone USB powered device based on a Raspberry Pi Zero W and additional hardware that accepts up to four USB Flash drives and will serve their content out over WIFI to one or more users. You can take it anywhere and plug it in to a USB power source. Within 90 seconds the device will be available. 

This repo will allow you to clone the required files rather than manually creating and editing all the files required to build the AirFlash as outlined in the [instructions article](http://blog.waynejohnson.net/doku.php/airflash).
